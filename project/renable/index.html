                        <h2>Renewable Energy:</h2>
                        <p>Energy production using renewable natural resources such as wind, sunlight, biomass, geothermal, etc. has gained high acceptance in recent years.
                            The Renewable Energy Program represents a response to the growing need for quality training in the renewable energy sector.
                            The Renewable Energy Program will focus on the fundamental practical applications of renewable energy.
                            The program firstly provides basic knowledge in the relevant electrical, electronic and mechanical disciplines that will be required to work practically in the renewable energy sector, while a number of renewable energy solutions and applications are emerging in our current environment. The program will address more than one renewable energy technology, and the program will give the student a foundation Well grounded in the science, as well as the installation techniques needed to work with different renewable energy solutions. The components will be solar energy, wind turbines, biomass energy and geothermal systems.
                            Best practices in health, safety and environmental conservation will play an essential role in all courses offered in the program including full safety training for working at heights and confined spaces.
                            The program will also present general concepts related to global climate change and practical applications related to sustainable energy, including conservation technologies.
                            Upon completion of the programme, students have gained experience and knowledge that will enable them to conduct site assessments for wind and photovoltaic projects with the ability to integrate with existing energy sources.
                            Graduates will have in-depth working knowledge of current practice in installation, commissioning, routine maintenance and repair of photovoltaic and wind power generation systems enabling them to work effectively in the field of wind energy facilities and solar PV operators. </p>
